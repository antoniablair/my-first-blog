# Django tutorial from Django Girls

If you don't know Django Girl and would like to try to build this blog, you can check out their tutorial [here](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/).

This repo has been updated to work with `python3`. 

## Installation
If you are here for a PyLadies Visual Studio Code workshop, you only need to download or git clone the repo in order to look at the code base in Visual Studio Code - you don't need to actually run the app.

However, if you are curious and would like to run the app locally, you can do the following:

- Clone the repo and go into the directory
- Make sure you have Django installed (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`). Ideally, you will want to do this in a virtual environment. 
- Set up your database migrations `python manage.py makemigrations`
- Start the server: `python manage.py runserver`
